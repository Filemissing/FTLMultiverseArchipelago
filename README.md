### Installing Multiverse
you can follow this guide [here](https://ftlmultiverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Installing_Multiverse) to install multiverse, this will also cover how to install the Hyperspace API.

I recommend using the [FTLman](https://github.com/afishhh/ftlman/releases) modmanager since I find it's the easiest to work with.

### Installing Super Magic Hat mods
simply drop the downloaded .zip file into the mods folder.

### Mod order
once you have all the dependencies installed and added FTLArchipelago.zip to the mod folder you need to check that all the mods are applied in the correct order (you can drag them up and down in FTLMan).

The correct order should be:
- Multiverse Assets
- Multiverse Data
- Super Magic Hat
- FTLArchipelago

once you have that just click apply and you're ready to go.
